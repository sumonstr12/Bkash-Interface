# bKash Digital Wallet Interface - Python Simulation

## üìå Project Overview

- Open on vsCode or others code editors.
- run Bkash.py


## Conclusion: 
This bKash CLI App was fully developed without using AI, as a personal learning project to better understand how Python works ‚Äî especially object-oriented programming using classes.

The primary goal was to explore how to build a real-world application structure using Python classes, methods, and objects. Through this project, I practiced breaking down functionalities (like login, send money, check balance, etc.). I try to managed this project with well-organized class-based components, which helped me truly understand:

- How to design and use Python classes effectively

- How to manage data and user interactions in a clean, modular way

- How real-life apps are structured internally using OOP principles

This project has been a stepping stone in my journey toward becoming a better Python programmer, and I‚Äôm proud to say: I built it all by myself, from logic to interface.
